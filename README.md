# Readme

1. The first experiment - a sort of braid-like time reverse system. But, doesn't work like the VCR way in the game. 
2. Experimenting with particles now with simple physical motions around the mouse pointer as an attraction source.
3. Managed to reach 170000 particles at 60 fps, and 400000 particles with 30 fps although with slight stuttering.
